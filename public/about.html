<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I don't really like to talk about me but in this case once we use a device like a PC,  <br>
  laptop, a phone or anything else similar I would like to explain why I chose to take this course, <br> 
  what made me do it, since early ages starting at around 10 years old i was curious about how a computer<br>
  or a phone work, to understand more I started opening my PC piece by piece ( When my parents weren't <br>
  at home of course) by the time they come back everything was back together and my PC was running normal <br>
  exactly like before or sligtly better, thats how I learned to change thermal paste on PC and GPU, to start a PC without <br>
  plugging a button to press on mother board, to build them and much more, also I learned how to fix phones, <br>
  I always had a huge curiosity specially in computers. I was doing this in a time when I did not had the "luxury" <br>
  to afford mistakes being the only computer I have and no acces at tutorials or videos like now days. <br>
